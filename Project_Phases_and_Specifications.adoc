== Project Overview

The **Company Template Project** is a modular .NET solution designed for building robust, cloud-native business applications. It integrates several key technologies, including **Aspire Framework** for modular services, **AI Semantic Kernel** for intelligent data processing, **Redis** for caching and real-time data operations, and a **Blazor WebAssembly** frontend for user interactions. The project is structured to ensure scalability, maintainability, and adherence to industry best practices.

== Project Phases

The project development is divided into the following phases to ensure systematic and organized progress:

1. **Phase 1**: Initial Setup and Core Module Development
   - Set up the project environment, folder structure, and essential configurations.
   - Develop core services like `CompanyService` and `ProductService`.
   
2. **Phase 2**: AI Integration
   - Implement the AI Semantic Kernel for natural language processing and intelligent data retrieval.
   - Develop models and prompts to handle user interactions.

3. **Phase 3**: Redis Caching
   - Set up Redis caching to enhance performance by storing frequently accessed data.
   - Implement the `RedisCacheService` for managing cache operations.

4. **Phase 4**: Policy and Compliance Documentation
   - Establish company policies and compliance documents such as Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Code of Conduct.
   - Integrate these documents with the project as templates for easy customization.

5. **Phase 5**: Management Modules
   - Develop modules for User Management, Employee Management, and Project Management.
   - Implement role-based access control and department-level configurations.

6. **Phase 6**: Frontend Development and API Communication
   - Build the Blazor WebAssembly frontend with API communication to backend services.
   - Ensure smooth data transfer and real-time updates between the frontend and backend.

7. **Phase 7**: Testing, CI/CD, and Deployment
   - Implement unit and integration testing.
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD and deploy the Blazor frontend to GitHub Pages.

== Deployment to GitHub Pages

The Blazor WebAssembly frontend is hosted on GitHub Pages using the `/docs` folder on the `main` branch. Ensure the following settings are configured in the repository:

1. Go to **Settings > Pages** in the repository.
2. Under **Source**, set the branch to `main` and folder to `/docs`.
3. Click **Save**.

GitHub Pages will then serve content from the `/docs` folder, and the site will be available at:
`https://chatgpt.com/g/g-J0FYgDhN5-software-architect-gpt/c/672c7503-9694-800f-87cd-38372ca128eb/`
